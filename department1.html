  <p class="sub-frame-para">A wide gamut of literature is today available in English, some created in it, others translated into it. It is this wide spectrum of literature in English that the course aims to introduce. This is an intensive course and
    should serve as an excellent initiation for students who want to base their careers on an in-depth study of literature. Possible avenues beckoning graduates are mass communication, civil services, creative writing, teaching, etc. The faculty here
    is a mix of young and experienced authors, scholars, critics and theatre activists.</p>
